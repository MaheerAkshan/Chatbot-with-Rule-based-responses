# Buddy Chatbot - A Rule-Based Chatbot with GUI

## 1. Description 
A Python-based rule-driven chatbot featuring a dual-panel interface built with Tkinter. The system employs keyword matching and response variation algorithms to simulate natural conversations while maintaining a complete interaction log.

## 2. Core Features 
- **Dual-Panel Interface**: Separate input and display windows
- **Adaptive Response System**: 50+ predefined response variations
- **Conversation Analytics**: Message timestamps and typing indicators
- **Context Modules**: Specialized handlers for:
  - Temporal queries (time/date)
  - Social interactions (greetings/goodbyes)
  - Help requests

## 3. Technical Implementation 
### Architecture Components:
- **Main Controller**: `BuddyChatbot` class
- **UI Framework**: Tkinter widgets
- **Response Engine**: Pattern-matching algorithm
- **Personality Module**: Mood and timing variations

### Key Methods:
- `generate_response()`: Core decision logic
- `add_message()`: Conversation logging
- `show_typing()`: Visual feedback system

## 4. Installation Guide 
### Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter library

### Setup:
1. Download project files
2. Navigate to project directory
3. Execute main script

## 5. Configuration Options 
### Behavioral Settings:
```python
self.mood = ["friendly", "professional", "humorous"]  # Personality variants
self.typing_speed = 0.1  # Response delay coefficient
```

## 6. Development Roadmap {#roadmap}
